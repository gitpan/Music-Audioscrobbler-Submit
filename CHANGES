CHANGES
    Release Name: 0.05
        *   Added new option: proxy_server to set proxy_server. Also now
            reads proxy server from enviroment.

    Release Name: 0.04
        *   I noticed that Music::Tag was called with a use function.
            Removed this line to remove Music::Tag requirement.

        *   Added some more level 4 debuging messages.

    Release Name: 0.03
        *   Added musictag_overwrite option. This is false by default. It is
            a workaround for problems with Music::Tag and unicode. Setting
            this to true allows Music::Tag info to overwrite info from MPD.
            Do not set this to true until Music::Tag returns proper unicode
            consistantly.

    Release Name: 0.02
        *   Will print error and die if lastfm_password is not set.

        *   Will print error and die if BADAUTH is received.

    Release Name: 0.01
        *   Initial Release
